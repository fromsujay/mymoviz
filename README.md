Hello Stranger, 

This is a program to fetch movies from the TMDb movie database using their API and specifying filter parameters. 
The program displays all the movies in card format & corresponding to filter parameters.  
There is also a functionality implemented to like movies and they are stored in a Mongo DB database in a persitent manner. When the user disconnects and reconnects, he or she can see the liked movies. 
A counter has also been implemented to keep track of the number of films liked and a popover box displays the names of maximum last three liked films. 

Happy Coding !
